Why Use Interfaces
    • When implementing a class from an interface we force
    it to implement all of the abstract methods.
    • The interface forces separation of what a class can do,
    to how it actually does it.
    • A programmer can change how something is done at
    any point, without changing the function of the class.
    • This facilitates the idea of polymorphism as the
    methods described in the interface will be implemented
    by all classes that implement the interface.
